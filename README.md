# Chapter 3 Lab - Task 1: Authentication Middleware

In this task, you will get a demo of a server that exposes an endpoint called “/posts” protected by password-based authenticated by which users can create or their created posts. The authentication is done through separated function (also called a middleware).

## Project Preparation

1. Clone or download the code from the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/houcine1amraoui/chap3lab-task1-auth-middleware
2. Open the project folder with VS Code.
3. Open the integrated terminal and run “npm install” command to install the dependencies.
4. Run “npm run start” command to run the server.

## Questions

1. Use postman to see the posts created by the user “amina-msila”.
2. Explain how authentication is performed by the server.
3. Now, create a new post by the user “mohamed-msila”.
4. Now, try to see the posts created by the user “mohamed-msila” but without providing the password and tell what the server has responded.
5. Tell what is the problem with such strategy and propose a solution.
